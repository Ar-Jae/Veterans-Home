# Honor Haven Veterans Home â€” Local dev

This workspace uses Vite + React.

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If Vite chooses a different port, it will print the chosen port in the console.

There's a VS Code task "Start Dev Server" that runs `npm run dev` as background task.
