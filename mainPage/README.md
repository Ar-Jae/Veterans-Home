# Honor Haven Veterans Home — mainPage (Standalone Frontend)

This is the standalone React frontend for the Honor Haven Veterans Home site, scaffolded with Vite.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Start dev server (default http://localhost:5173):

   npm run dev

3. Build for production:

   npm run build

4. Preview the production build locally:

   npm run preview

Notes
- The dev server runs on port 5173 by default. Use `--host` in the `dev` command or set a Vite config to expose the server to the network.
- This project is intentionally standalone. To integrate with your existing server API, point fetch/XHR requests to your server's base URL.

Files of interest
- `index.html` — HTML entry point
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry
- `src/App.jsx` — Example app component

If you want, I can add Tailwind, copy components from the `client` folder, or wire the frontend to your server API.
